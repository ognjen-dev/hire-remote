If you pay hourly, or monthly, please convert to annual equivalent yourself (hourly rate * 8h * 22d * 12mo OR monthly salary * 12mo). Our robot can also convert it but it's not perfect and it might make a mistake if you enter it differently than annual. If not sure, write an indication of the salary." />
